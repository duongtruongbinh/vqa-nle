Let me look at the picture again. There's a person taking a dish out of the oven, which is open. The stove has a control panel with dials and buttons, which suggests it might be an electric stove because those are common controls for electric ones. But there are also burners on top, like the gas burners you see with knobs and the canister on top. Wait, the gas burners are there, so that would mean it's a gas stove. But electric stoves don't have burners, right? So if there are gas burners, it's a gas stove. But sometimes electric stoves can have a heating element that looks like a gas burner. Hmm, the control panel here has a digital display and buttons, which is typical for electric stoves. But the presence of the actual gas burners (the burners on the stove top) would indicate it's a gas stove. So maybe it's a gas stove with electric elements. But the question is whether it's gas or electric. The image shows both burners and an electric oven, so the stove itself uses gas.
