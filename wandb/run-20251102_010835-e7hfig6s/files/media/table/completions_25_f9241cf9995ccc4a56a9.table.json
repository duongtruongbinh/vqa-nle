Let me start by looking at the picture again. The oven is a modern electric model, right? There's a control panel with digital displays and buttons, which typically indicates it's an electric oven. The top part of the oven has a gas stove, as there are multiple burners and a red pot on one of them. But the oven itself, which is what the question is about, seems to be electric. Electric ovens usually have a control panel for temperature and settings, which matches what I see here. Gas ovens often have knobs and a separate gas range, but this one has the electric oven integrated with the gas stove on top. So the answer should be that the oven is electric.\n</think>\n\n<answer>b\u00ecnh \u0111i\u1ec7n</answer>\n<explain>B\u00ecnh s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng \u0111i\u1ec7n, v\u00ec c\u00f3 b\u1ea3ng \u0111i\u1ec1u khi\u1ec3n \u0111i\u1ec7n t\u1eed v\u00e0 c\u00e1c n\u00fat \u0111i\u1ec1u khi\u1ec3n \u0111\u1eb7c tr\u01b0ng c\u1ee7a b\u00ecnh \u0111i\u1ec7n.

The question is asking whether the stove in the image uses gas or electric. From the image, I can see that there are four burners on top of the stove, which are typical for gas stoves. The burners have knobs on them, which are used to control the flame. Gas stoves usually have these knobs to turn on and adjust the heat, whereas electric stoves might have switches or buttons instead. Also, the stove has a control panel with a digital display and buttons, which is common for electric stoves. Wait, but some electric stoves can also have gas burners. Hmm. Let me check again. The presence of multiple knobs on the top suggests it's a gas stove. Electric stoves typically have a different design for the burners and controls. So I think the answer is gas.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Gas</answer>\n<explain>B\u1ebfp c\u00f3 nhi\u1ec1u \u1ed1ng \u0111un (4 \u1ed1ng) v\u00e0 c\u00e1c c\u00f4ng t\u1eafc tay, \u0111\u1eb7c tr\u01b0ng c\u1ee7a b\u1ebfp gas.

The question is asking whether the stove in the image uses gas or electricity. I need to look at the stove to determine that.\n\nFirst, I remember that gas stoves usually have a visible gas burner, like the ones with knobs and flames. Electric stoves might have coils or a glass top. In the image, there's a stove with knobs and a gas burner visible. There's a pot on the gas burner, and the stove has a control panel with a digital display and buttons, which might be for an electric stove. Wait, some electric stoves also have digital controls. Hmm, but the presence of the gas burner with knobs is a key indicator. The knobs here are for controlling gas flow, so that suggests it's a gas stove. Also, the design of the stove with the gas burners and the metallic parts around them points to a gas-powered one. Electric stoves typically don't have individual knobs for each burner like this. So I think the stove here is gas-powered.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Gas</answer>\n<explain>Stove c\u00f3 nhi\u1ec1u \u1ed1ng kh\u00f3i v\u00e0 tay c\u1ea7m \u0111i\u1ec1u khi\u1ec3n, \u0111\u1eb7c tr\u01b0ng c\u1ee7a b\u1ebfp ga.
