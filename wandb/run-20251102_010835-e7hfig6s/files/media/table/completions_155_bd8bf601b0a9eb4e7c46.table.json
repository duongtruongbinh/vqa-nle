The floor is tiled with square tiles. Based on the pattern and texture, I can infer that the flooring is made of ceramic tiles, which are common in bathrooms due to their durability and water resistance.\n\nThe tiles appear to be large and evenly spaced, with grout lines visible between them. The color of the tiles seems to be a light shade, possibly beige or light gray, which is typical for bathroom flooring as it hides dirt and stains well.\n\nThe tiles are laid out in a regular pattern, which suggests that they are arranged in a grid-like fashion. This type of arrangement is common in many bathrooms to create a neat and orderly appearance.\n\nThe bathroom appears to be well-lit, with a light source illuminating the space. This light helps to highlight the clean and tidy appearance of the bathroom, which is important in maintaining a hygienic environment.\n\nThe overall design of the bathroom seems to be simple and functional, with a focus on practicality rather than elaborate decor. The use of ceramic tiles is a practical choice for a bathroom, as they are easy to clean and maintain.\n\nBased on these observations, I can conclude that the floor in this bathroom is made of large, square ceramic tiles, which are arranged in a grid-like pattern.
