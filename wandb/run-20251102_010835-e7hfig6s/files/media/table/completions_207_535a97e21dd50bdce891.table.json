The question is asking if the water in the image appears to be moving. The user wants a one-word answer in Vietnamese, followed by an explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the image. The water looks a bit choppy, maybe with some small waves. There's no big waves or a boat causing movement, but the surface does have ripples. That could indicate some movement, maybe wind or the tide. However, sometimes even still water can look wavy if there's a slight breeze. But in this case, the ripples are more noticeable, so it's probably moving.

In the image, there are visible ripples and some waves, especially towards the bottom of the photo. The water doesn't look completely still; there are small disturbances. However, the presence of the buildings and boats in the background might suggest that there's a current or wind causing these ripples.
