The question is asking if it's raining in the image. First, I need to check the weather conditions shown. The sky looks overcast with dark clouds, which often indicates rain.

But the person is wearing a raincoat, which usually means it's raining. Also, the tarmac looks wet, which supports the idea of rain.

The question is asking if it's raining. I need to check the image for any signs of rain, like wet surfaces or people carrying umbrellas.

However, there are no visible raindrops or people with umbrellas. Maybe the person in the image is wearing a raincoat.

The question is asking if it's raining in the image. I need to check the weather conditions shown. The sky looks overcast, which usually means cloudy, but does that mean it's raining? Sometimes overcast skies can be rainy, but maybe it's just cloudy without rain. I should look for any visible raindrops or wet surfaces. The ground appears to be wet, which might indicate recent rain. But the sky doesn't show streaks or heavy rain. Maybe it's drizzling? Or perhaps it's just cloudy and not actively raining. I need to decide based on the evidence in the image. If there's no visible raindrops hitting the ground, maybe it's just a cloudy day. But the wet pavement could mean recent rain.
