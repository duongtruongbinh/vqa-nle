The question is asking if today is a sunny day based on the image provided. First, I need to look at the image. The sky looks clear and blue without any clouds. There's a skateboarder wearing a helmet and doing a trick on a ramp, which suggests good visibility. The environment appears to be outdoors with natural sunlight illuminating the scene. The person's shadows are visible on the ground, indicating the presence of sunlight. The overall brightness of the image and the clear sky are signs of a sunny day. There are no signs of rain or overcast conditions. So, putting this all together, it seems like today is indeed a sunny day.\n</think>\n\n<answer>C\u00f3</answer>\n<explain>B\u1ea7u tr\u1eddi trong h\u00ecnh r\u00f5 r\u00e0ng v\u00e0 kh\u00f4ng c\u00f3 m\u00e2y, \u0111i\u1ec1u n\u00e0y ch\u1ec9 ra r\u1eb1ng tr\u1eddi n\u1eafng. \u00c1nh s\u00e1ng m\u1eb7t tr\u1eddi chi\u1ebfu s\u00e1ng khu v\u1ef1c, v\u00e0 b\u00f3ng c\u1ee7a ng\u01b0\u1eddi tr\u01b0\u1ee3t skateboard tr\u00ean m\u1eb7t \u0111\u1ea5t, cho th\u1ea5y c\u00f3 \u00e1nh n\u1eafng m\u1ea1nh.
