There are two giraffes standing near a fence. The tall one is much bigger than the smaller one next to it. Giraffes are known for their long necks and distinctive coat patterns with large brown patches. The background has trees and what looks like an enclosure, maybe a zoo setting. The question is asking what kind of animals they are. Based on the visible features, like the height and the pattern on their coats, they are definitely giraffes.
