Let's look at the details. There's a person on a tennis court, wearing a skirt and a tennis racket. The court has the typical markings and lines for tennis.

There are also basketball hoops in the background, but the main focus is on the tennis court and the person holding the racket.\n\nWait, the person is wearing a skirt and a skirt with tennis shoes. That's a bit unusual for tennis players, who usually wear shorts. But maybe it's a fashion choice for this particular player. The key elements are the tennis court, the racket, and the person's attire. The sport being played here is tennis. The background has basketball hoops, but the question is about the main sport in the image, which is tennis.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Th\u1ec3 thao</answer>  \n<explain>B\u1ee9c \u1ea3nh cho th\u1ea5y m\u1ed9t ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111ang ch\u01a1i tennis tr\u00ean s\u00e2n tennis, v\u1edbi ng\u01b0\u1eddi ch\u01a1i s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng gi\u00e0y da v\u00e0 c\u00e2y tennis.</explain>", 1.0, 0.4712463617324829, 0.36668816208839417, -1.1037269830703735, "<answer>qu\u1ea7n v\u1ee3t</answer><explain>ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u00e0n \u00f4ng \u0111ang c\u1ea7m v\u1ee3t b\u00ean ngo\u00e0i.</explain>"], ["436", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Visual Question Answering system.
