The image doesn't show any visible raindrops or wet surfaces. The beach looks dry, and the people on the horses aren't holding umbrellas or wearing rain gear. The horses' coats look clean, so there's no sign of rainwater. Also, the sea is calm with gentle waves, not choppy. So, even though the sky is cloudy, there's no indication of rain happening at the moment.
