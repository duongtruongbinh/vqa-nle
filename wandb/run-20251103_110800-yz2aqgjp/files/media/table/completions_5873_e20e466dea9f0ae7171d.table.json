They're wearing skis and ski poles, and they have backpacks. Let me think about what they're doing here. The tunnel entrance is in a snowy area, which suggests it's a ski resort. The people are standing at the entrance, facing away from the camera, so they might be preparing to enter the tunnel. But wait, tunnels at ski resorts are usually for people to go in, maybe to avoid the crowd or go through to another part. Since they have skis on, maybe they're skiing through the tunnel. Or perhaps they're about to enter the tunnel, maybe to go back to a lift or another area. But the question is asking what activity they're performing. The options are skiing, hiking, snowboarding, or something else. Since they have skis on, it's likely skiing. The tunnel entrance might be a part of the ski resort's infrastructure, so the activity is skiing through the tunnel. But wait, sometimes tunnels are used for maintenance or to go to another part of the resort. But the image shows them with skis and poles, so the activity is skiing. The answer should be skiing.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Skiing</answer>\n<explain>C\u00e1c ng\u01b0\u1eddi trong h\u00ecnh \u0111ang trang b\u1ecb skis v\u00e0 pole, cho th\u1ea5y h\u1ecd \u0111ang th\u1ef1c hi\u1ec7n ho\u1ea1t \u0111\u1ed9ng \u0111i tuy\u1ebft.</explain>", 1.0, 0.304155558347702, 0.3826594054698944, -0.2688089907169342, "<answer>tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft</answer><explain>h\u1ecd c\u00f3 v\u00e1n tr\u01b0\u1ee3t v\u00e0 c\u00f3 tuy\u1ebft tr\u00ean m\u1eb7t \u0111\u1ea5t</explain>"], ["267", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Visual Question Answering system.

The image shows two people with skis and poles approaching a tunnel entrance. The tunnel is made of stone with snow around it. The people are wearing winter clothing, like jackets and pants, and they have backpacks. They're carrying skis, so they're probably skiing.\n\nWait, the question is asking what they are doing. The main activity here is skiing, right? Because they have skis and poles, and they're entering a tunnel. The tunnel might be a ski tunnel or a mountain pass used for skiing. So their activity is skiing. Maybe they're going to ski through the tunnel or using it as a shortcut. But the primary activity is skiing. The answer should be \"skiing\" in Vietnamese.
