There's no direct evidence of someone playing golf, like golf clubs or equipment. The newspaper could indicate that the person might be interested in golf, but it's not clear if they actually play it. So, the answer would be yes based on the newspaper, but it's not definitive.

The newspaper has the word \"GOLF\" and mentions \"U.S. Masters,\" which is a big golf tournament.

The headline says \"GOLFLEHTI\" and mentions U.S. Masters. The word \"GOLFLEHTI\" might be a typo or a stylized version of \"Golflehti,\" which could be related to golf news. Since there's a newspaper article about golf on the table, it suggests that someone in the house is interested in golf. The presence of multiple remote controls might indicate they use them for watching TV, possibly a sports channel where golf is being covered.
