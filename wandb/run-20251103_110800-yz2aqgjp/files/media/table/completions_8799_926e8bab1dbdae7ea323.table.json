Let me look at the picture again. There are three people on skis on a snow-covered area. They have ski poles and are wearing winter clothing suitable for skiing. The person in the foreground is wearing a red outfit, and the others are in orange and black. They appear to be cross-country skiing because they're moving with skis that have bindings for feet, and they're using ski poles. The environment looks like a flat, open field with trees in the background, which is typical for cross-country skiing courses rather than downhill skiing which would be on a slope. Also, the way they're positioned with their poles and skis suggests they're gliding across the snow, which is a key part of cross-country skiing. I don't see any signs of a mountain or a ski lift, so it's more likely cross-country. The person in the foreground seems to be leading the way. So the answer should be cross-country skiing.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Crocski</answer>\n<explain>Crocski l\u00e0 m\u00f4n th\u1ec3 thao \u0111ang di\u1ec5n ra trong h\u00ecnh, v\u1edbi ba ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111ang s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng skis v\u00e0 pole tr\u00ean m\u1ed9t khu v\u1ef1c tuy\u1ebft.
