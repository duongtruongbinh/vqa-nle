The edges of the crust have some blackened spots, which might indicate it's been overcooked or has a well-done crust. However, not all parts are completely burned, just a few areas look slightly burnt.

There are two pizzas on the table. The first one on the left has a topping of greens and what looks like grated cheese, maybe Parmesan. The crust here seems to have some charred areas, especially around the edges. The second pizza on the right has a different topping with green peppers and onions, and its crust also appears to have some char marks.\n\nThe question is asking if the crust has been burned. So I need to check the appearance of the crusts. From the image, both pizzas show some spots where the crust is darker and more charred, especially around the edges. Even though it's not completely burnt, the presence of those charred areas indicates that the crust has been slightly overcooked or has charring from the cooking process.\n\nSo the answer should be yes, the crust has some burnt spots. The explanation would note the darker, blackened areas on the crusts.\n</think>\n\n<answer>C\u00f3</answer>\n<explain>C\u00e1nh gi\u00f2 c\u00f3 nh\u1eefng ch\u1ed7 b\u1ecb ch\u00e1y m\u00e0u \u0111en, \u0111\u1eb7c bi\u1ec7t \u1edf vi\u1ec1n pizza.</explain>", 1.0, 1.0, 0.4626403748989105, 0.495900422334671, "<answer>c\u00f3</answer><explain>c\u00f3 v\u1ebft \u0111en do n\u1ea5u qu\u00e1 l\u00e2u</explain>"]]}
