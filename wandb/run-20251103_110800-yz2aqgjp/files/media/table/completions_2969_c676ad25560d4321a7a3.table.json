There's a clock with two faces, and it's mounted on a structure. The question is asking if it's a wristwatch. But wristwatches are typically small and worn on the wrist, not mounted on a wall or post. The one in the picture is quite large, with two dials, which is more characteristic of a wall clock or public timepiece rather than a personal wristwatch. Also, the presence of a sign above it with horses racing might indicate that this is a clock in a location like a racetrack, not a personal watch.
