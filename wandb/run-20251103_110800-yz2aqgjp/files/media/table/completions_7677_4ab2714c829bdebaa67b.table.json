The puppy has a fluffy white coat, which is typical for breeds like a Labrador or Golden Retriever. Since the image shows a young dog with a smooth coat, it's likely a puppy. The answer should be a dog, specifically a puppy. The other objects in the image, like the furniture and pictures, aren't relevant to the question.
