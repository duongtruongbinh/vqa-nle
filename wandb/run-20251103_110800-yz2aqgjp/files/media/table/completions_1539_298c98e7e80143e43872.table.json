The question is asking which team he plays for. The image shows a baseball player wearing a uniform with the name \"Orioles\" written on it. The team logo and the name \"Orioles\" are clearly visible on the front of the jersey. The jersey is white with orange and black accents. The player is wearing a cap with a logo that matches the team's emblem. So based on the uniform, he's part of the Baltimore Orioles team. I should check if there's any other possible team, but the name and colors are distinct.
