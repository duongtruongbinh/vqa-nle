The image shows a bathroom with a vanity on the left side, a mirror above it, and a towel hanging there. Then there's a bathtub with a window above it and a toilet on the right. The floor has a patterned tile design. So the question is asking what type of room this is. Based on the elements like the sink, mirror, bathtub, and toilet, it's clearly a bathroom. I should make sure there's no other possible room that fits. The presence of a shower curtain or a towel suggests it's a bathroom, not a washroom but that's the same.
