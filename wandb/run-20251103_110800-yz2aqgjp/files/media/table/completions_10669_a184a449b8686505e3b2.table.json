The question is asking if the person in the image is wearing sports pants. The image shows someone riding a skateboard. They're wearing jeans and sneakers. Wait, sports pants usually refer to athletic wear, like track pants or something similar. But the person here is wearing blue jeans, which are more casual or regular jeans. So, jeans aren't considered sports pants. The sneakers could be casual shoes, not necessarily athletic ones. So the answer should be no, they're not wearing sports pants. The explanation is that they're wearing jeans instead of athletic pants.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Kh\u00f4ng</answer>\n<explain>Ng\u01b0\u1eddi tr\u01b0\u1ee3t b\u0103ng \u0111ang m\u1eb7c qu\u1ea7n jeans, kh\u00f4ng ph\u1ea3i qu\u1ea7n th\u1ec3 thao.</explain>", 1.0, 1.0000001192092896, 0.47645923495292664, 0.6023489236831665, "<answer>kh\u00f4ng</answer><explain>qu\u1ea7n l\u00e0 ch\u1ea5t li\u1ec7u jean c\u00f3 \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng kh\u00e2u</explain>"], ["485", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Visual Question Answering system.

Sportswear usually refers to clothing made for athletic activities, like gym clothes, sports bras, etc. Jeans are typically casual wear, not sportswear. Sneakers are common for sports, but the jeans themselves aren't considered sportswear. So, even though they're wearing sneakers, the main question is about whether they're wearing sportswear. Since the primary clothing is jeans, which are casual, the answer would be no.
