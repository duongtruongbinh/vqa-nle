Let me start by looking at the scene. There's a person on a snowy slope, surrounded by trees without leaves, which suggests it's winter. The man is wearing a blue jacket, black pants, gloves, and he has a helmet on. He's on a snowboard, right? He's leaning forward with one arm extended and the other bent, and there's snow spraying around his board. \n\nHmm, the key actions here are the snowboard and the way he's positioned. He's definitely not skiing because he has one board instead of two skis. The fact that he's spraying snow as he moves suggests he's actively carving or turning on the snow. Since he's leaning forward and the snow is being kicked up, it looks like he's in motion, probably going downhill. \n\nWait, but could he be doing a trick? Maybe, but the posture and the fact that he's surrounded by trees might imply he's just riding down the slope. The snow spray indicates movement, and his posture is typical for snowboarding downhill. I don't see any other equipment or a platform that would suggest he's doing a trick. So, putting it all together, he's snowboarding downhill.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\u0110ang l\u01b0\u1edbt tuy\u1ebft</answer>  \n<explain>Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u00e0n \u00f4ng \u0111ang l\u01b0\u1edbt tuy\u1ebft tr\u00ean m\u1ed9t con d\u1ed1c, s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng m\u1ed9t chi\u1ebfc\u0e40\u0e17 n\u01b0\u1edbc v\u00e0 \u0111ang di chuy\u1ec3n v\u1edbi t\u1ed1c \u0111\u1ed9, t\u1ea1o ra c\u00e1c v\u1ec7t b\u1eafn tuy\u1ebft xung quanh.
