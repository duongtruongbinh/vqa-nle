They might be participating in a track event like short track or cross-country skiing. The key details are the number 13, the bib with the Olympics logo, and the setting at Vancouver 2010.

The image shows a skier on the ice, wearing a bib with the number 13 and the Vancouver 2010 logo. The skier is raising their arms in the air, which usually indicates victory or celebration.

The presence of flags and the Olympic rings suggests it's an Olympic event. So the question is asking what they are doing. The answer should be that they are celebrating a victory or winning the race.\n</think>\n\n<answer>C\u00f9ng nhau vui m\u1eebng chi\u1ebfn th\u1eafng</answer>\n<explain>Ng\u01b0\u1eddi skier gi\u01a1 tay ch\u00e0o m\u1eebng chi\u1ebfn th\u1eafng sau khi gi\u00e0nh huy ch\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1ea1i V\u91dc\u5c71 2010.</explain>", 1.0, 0.32872313261032104, 0.604945719242096, 0.8621012568473816, "<answer>tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft</answer><explain>h\u1ecd \u0111ang \u0111eo gi\u00e0y tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft trong tuy\u1ebft</explain>"], ["139", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Visual Question Answering system.
