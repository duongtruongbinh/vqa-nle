The man is seated on a bench, has a guitar in his lap, and there's a bag next to him. The image shows him strumming the guitar. So the answer should be guitar.

The question is asking what the person in the image is holding. First, I need to focus on the main subject. The person is sitting on a bench, right? They're wearing a hat and a black jacket. Now, looking at their hands, they have a guitar. The guitar is positioned under their chin and they're strumming it. So the answer should be guitar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Sometimes people might confuse other instruments, but the shape and the way it's held clearly looks like a guitar. Also, the person's posture is typical for playing guitar while sitting. There's no other object in their hands. The bag next to them might be a guitar case, but the question is about what they're holding, not nearby items.
