Let me start by looking at the picture carefully. The person is wearing a white and red suit, which makes me think they might be a skier or snowboarder. They're wearing a helmet and goggles, which are typical for winter sports to protect from the cold and protect the eyes from snow glare.\n\nThe person is on skis, and they're leaning to the right, with one ski pointed towards a red flag. The flag is a common marker used in skiing or snowboarding courses, especially in cross-country skiing or slalom events. The red flag usually indicates a turn or a change in direction. The person's posture, leaning forward with knees bent, suggests they're actively maneuvering around the flag, which is typical in slalom skiing where skiers have to navigate through a series of gates or flags.\n\nLooking at the surroundings, there's snow on the ground, and some trees in the background. There's also a green net or fence to the left side of the image, which might be part of the course boundary to keep the skier within the designated area. The skier is wearing specialized gear, including a helmet, goggles, and possibly a race suit, which is often used in competitive skiing.\n\nConsidering all these elements\u2014skis, helmet, goggles, red flag, and the course setup\u2014it's highly likely that the person is engaged in a cross-country skiing or slalom event. They are making a turn around the red flag, which is a key part of such races where timing and precise navigation are crucial.\n\nI should also check if there are any other details. The skier's stance and the position of the skis suggest they're actively making a turn, which is necessary to avoid hitting the flag and to maintain speed. The snow on the ground is undisturbed around the skier, indicating they are the only one using this part of the course at the moment.\n\nPutting it all together, the person is most likely a skier participating in a competitive event, navigating through the course by making turns around the flags. The specific activity here is cross-country skiing or slalom skiing, where the objective is to complete the course as quickly as possible while navigating through the gates without knocking them over.\n</think>\n\n<answer>L\u01b0\u1edbt v\u00e1n (ho\u1eb7c cross-country) qua c\u1ed9t</answer>\n<explain>Ng\u01b0\u1eddi n\u00e0y \u0111ang th\u1ef1c hi\u1ec7n m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ed9ng t\u00e1c l\u01b0\u1edbt v\u00e1n ho\u1eb7c cross-country qua m\u1ed9t c\u1ed9t c\u1edd m\u00e0u \u0111\u1ecf, th\u1ec3 hi\u1ec7n s\u1ef1 \u0111i\u1ec1u khi\u1ec3n v\u00e0 th\u0103ng b\u1eb1ng trong skiing.

The image shows someone on skis, right? They're wearing a white and red outfit, which is probably ski gear. They're leaning to the side, and there's a red flag nearby. The ground is covered in snow, and there are trees in the background. The person is making a sharp turn, maybe doing a slalom or a trick. The question is asking what the person is doing. So, the answer should be something like skiing or performing a trick. But since the image specifically shows a ski maneuver, the action here is likely skiing with a turn or a trick. Let me make sure there's no other activity. No, it's definitely skiing. The skier is in a position that suggests they're maneuvering through the course, possibly using the flags as markers.
