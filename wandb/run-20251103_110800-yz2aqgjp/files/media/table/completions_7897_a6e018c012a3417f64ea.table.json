The question is asking which animals are going down to the water. The image shows a group of zebras and wildebeests near the river.

I need to make sure there aren't any other animals in the picture. There's also a van in the background, but that's not an animal.

Then there are a bunch of what looks like buffalo or wildebeest on the right side. They're also near the water. There's also a bunch of birds, probably waterfowl, in the middle of the water. The question is asking which animals are going into the water. The zebras and the buffalo are on the shore, maybe drinking or preparing to drink. The birds are already in the water. So the answer should be the zebras and the buffalo.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Ng\u1ef1a, h\u01b0\u01a1u v\u00e0 chim n\u01b0\u1edbc</answer>\n<explain>C\u00f3 th\u1ec3 th\u1ea5y c\u00e1c nh\u00f3m ng\u1ef1a v\u00e0 h\u01b0\u01a1u \u0111ang ti\u1ebfn v\u1ec1 ph\u00eda n\u01b0\u1edbc, trong khi c\u00e1c chim n\u01b0\u1edbc \u0111ang di chuy\u1ec3n trong n\u01b0\u1edbc.

The image shows a river with several animals. On the left side, there's a group of zebras. Some are already in the water, and others are walking towards it. On the right side, there are some wildebeests near the bank, and some of them might be moving towards the water. There's also a vehicle in the background on the opposite bank. The question is asking which animals are going down to the water. So, I need to identify which species are present.\n\nFirst, the zebras: they have black and white stripes, and there are three of them. They are definitely in the water or approaching it. Then, on the right side, there are dark-colored animals with curved horns, which are wildebeests. There are at least two of them visible near the bank. So the answer should be zebras and wildebeests. Let me check if there are any other animals. Maybe some birds in the water, but the question is about the ones going down to the water, so probably the zebras and wildebeests are the main ones.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Zebras v\u00e0 Wildebeest</answer>\n<explain>C\u00e1c con h\u01b0\u01a1u n\u01b0\u1edbc (zebra) v\u00e0 c\u1eebu (wildebeest) \u0111ang \u0111i xu\u1ed1ng s\u00f4ng n\u01b0\u1edbc.
