The tiger is the cartoon character on the container. The image also shows various food items like rice, cheese, broccoli, and some vegetables. But the question is specifically about the animal depicted. The tiger is clearly on the lunchbox lid, and it's the main focus of the container's design. There are no other animals visible in the food items.
