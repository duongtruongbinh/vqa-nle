The question is asking what the animal in the image is. The image shows a large, grey animal with a long trunk and a big ear. It's standing next to a ball on the ground. I know that elephants are the ones with trunks, but the trunk here is a bit short compared to adult elephants. Wait, but maybe it's a baby elephant? Or a young one. The trunk looks like it's in a playful position, touching the ball. The ears are also large, which is typical for elephants. They usually have two large ears, and this one seems to have one visible ear. The background is a fence, so this could be a zoo or sanctuary setting. The animal's skin is grey, and it's standing on a path. Considering the size and the trunk, it's probably an elephant. The name in Vietnamese for elephant is \"ng\u1ef1a b\u00f2\" or \"h\u01b0\u01a1u,\" but more commonly \"h\u01b0\u01a1u.\" Let me double-check. Yes, h\u01b0\u01a1u is the correct term for elephant in Vietnamese.
