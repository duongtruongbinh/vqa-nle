The image shows a man on a surfboard riding a wave. So, the question is asking what the man is doing. He's definitely surfing because he's on the board in the water, and there's a wave around him. He's in a wet suit, which is typical for surfers to stay warm in the water. His posture is balanced, with one arm raised, which surfers often do to maintain balance or carve turns. There's no other activity visible here, like swimming or fishing.

The movement of the water and his stance indicate he's actively surfing. So the answer should be that he's surfing.
