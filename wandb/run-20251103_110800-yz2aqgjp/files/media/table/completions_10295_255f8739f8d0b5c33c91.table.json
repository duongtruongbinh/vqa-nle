There's a sheep standing on the left side, and a cat on the right. The sheep is white with a woolly coat, and the cat is brown and black. Then, in the middle panel, there's another sheep, which is white and has its head turned to the left. The cat is still there, now on the right side. The right panel shows another sheep and the cat again. So in all three panels, there's a sheep and a cat. The sheep is white with some darker patches, and the cat has a mix of brown and black fur. \n\nThe user's question is straightforward: does the image show a sheep and a cat?
