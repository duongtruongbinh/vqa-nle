The question is asking if the laptop in the image is turned on. The user wants a one-word answer in Vietnamese followed by an explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the laptop. The screen shows a desktop background, which usually means the laptop is on. But wait, sometimes even if the screen is on, the laptop might be in sleep mode. But generally, if the screen is on, it's considered powered on. Also, the keyboard is lit up, which might indicate it's on. There's also a mouse next to it, which might be connected. So based on the visible indicators, the laptop appears to be on. The answer should be \"C\u00f3\" (Yes).

There's a laptop and a regular keyboard on the desk. The laptop screen is turned on, so the monitor is visible. But wait, the laptop's power indicator might not be clearly visible. Usually, if the laptop is on, the screen would be lit up. Since the screen is showing some content, it's likely the laptop is turned on. But sometimes, even if the screen is on, the power might be off if the battery is dead, but that's less common. The keyboard next to it isn't being used, so maybe it's a separate device.
