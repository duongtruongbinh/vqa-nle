The sky is overcast with grey clouds, which might suggest that it's a cloudy day. However, the ground is covered in snow, and the skier is skiing, which implies that there's snow on the ground. There's no visible snowfall in the image, like snowflakes falling from the sky. The skier appears to be actively skiing, so there's enough snow on the ground for skiing, but there's no indication that snow is currently falling. Therefore, it's more likely that there's no snowfall at the moment, but it's still a snowy day.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Kh\u00f4ng</answer>\n<explain>C\u00f3 tuy\u1ebft nh\u01b0ng kh\u00f4ng r\u01a1i</explain>", 1.0, 1.0000001192092896, 0.2473905384540558, -0.9732844829559326, "<answer>kh\u00f4ng</answer><explain>h\u00f4m qua \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 tuy\u1ebft r\u01a1i v\u00e0 b\u00e3o \u0111\u00e3 qua \u0111i</explain>"], ["478", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Visual Question Answering system.

The skier is on a snowy slope, and there are ski lifts in the background. The sky appears overcast, but I don't see any visible snowflakes or signs of snowfall happening. The ground is covered in snow, but it doesn't look fresh or disturbed by snowfall. There's no indication of snow falling right now. So, probably not. The skier is already skiing, which suggests it's snowing, but maybe the snowfall is just ongoing. Wait, maybe the answer is no because the sky is cloudy but no active snowfall visible. Hmm, but sometimes cloudy skies can have snowfall even if not seen. But since there's no visible snowflakes in the image, I think the answer would be no.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Kh\u00f4ng</answer>\n<explain>Tr\u1eddi c\u00f3 m\u00e2y x\u00e1m nh\u01b0ng kh\u00f4ng th\u1ea5y d\u1ea5u hi\u1ec7u c\u1ee7a tuy\u1ebft r\u01a1i trong h\u00ecnh \u1ea3nh.</explain>", 1.0, 1.0000001192092896, 0.27890706062316895, -0.04706837236881256, "<answer>kh\u00f4ng</answer><explain>h\u00f4m qua \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 tuy\u1ebft r\u01a1i v\u00e0 b\u00e3o \u0111\u00e3 qua \u0111i</explain>"], ["478", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Visual Question Answering system.

The image shows a person skiing on a snow-covered slope with trees in the background. The sky looks overcast, maybe even cloudy, which could mean it's still possible for snow to fall. But I need to determine if there's snowfall happening now.\n\nLooking at the scene, the skier is wearing a jacket and goggles, which might be prepared for snow, but there's no visible snow falling in the picture. The ground is covered with snow, and the trees are also dusted with snow, but no new snowflakes are falling. The person appears to be actively skiing, so they're probably already prepared for the conditions. \n\nAlso, the background has a ski lift and some people, but none of them are holding up umbrellas or wearing hoods, which might indicate that it's not actively snowing. The overcast sky could mean it's just cloudy, not necessarily actively snowing. So, based on the image, there's no visible snowfall happening right now. The answer should be that it's not currently snowing.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Kh\u00f4ng</answer>\n<explain>Kh\u00f4ng c\u00f3 d\u1ea5u hi\u1ec7u tuy\u1ebft r\u01a1i t\u1ea1i th\u1eddi \u0111i\u1ec3m n\u00e0y, ch\u1ec9 c\u00f3 tr\u1eddi nhi\u1ec1u m\u00e2y v\u00e0 tuy\u1ebft \u0111\u00e3 ph\u1ee7 l\u00ean c\u00e1c v\u1eadt th\u1ec3 xung quanh.</explain>", 1.0, 1.0000001192092896, 0.31522810459136963, 1.020347237586975, "<answer>kh\u00f4ng</answer><explain>h\u00f4m qua \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 tuy\u1ebft r\u01a1i v\u00e0 b\u00e3o \u0111\u00e3 qua \u0111i</explain>"]]}
