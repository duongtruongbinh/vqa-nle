The question is asking if the water has ripples. I need to look at the image carefully. The water surface appears mostly calm, but there might be some small disturbances. The boat's reflection is clear, which suggests the water is relatively still. However, there are some slight disturbances around the boat, maybe from the boat moving or the people on it. There's a bit of a ripple effect near the boat, especially where the reflection is breaking.

The question is asking if the water has waves. First, I need to look at the image. The boat is on a lake, and the water appears calm. The reflection of the trees and the boat is clear, which usually happens when the water is still. If there were waves, the reflection would be distorted or broken up. There's no visible movement or ripples on the surface of the water. The people on the boat don't seem to be struggling, which also suggests calm conditions.
