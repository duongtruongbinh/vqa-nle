Let me start by looking at the road signs in the image. There are green highway signs indicating exits. The main highway numbers visible are 95, 395, and 495. The signs show directions for different exits: one pointing to Baltimore, another to Washington, and another to Tysons Corner.\n\nThe question is asking if I should take the exit for Baltimore. The key here is to identify which exit is labeled as Baltimore. Looking at the signs, there's an exit for Baltimore with an arrow pointing left. The exit numbers for Baltimore are 95 North, 395 North, and 495 North, all leading to Baltimore. The direction for Baltimore is to the left. \n\nSo, if I'm heading towards Baltimore, I should take the left exit as indicated by the sign. The other exits, like Washington and Tysons Corner, are to the right, so they're not relevant for a Baltimore destination. I should check the lane designations to make sure I'm in the correct lane for the left exit. The lanes are marked with dashed lines, and the leftmost lane probably leads to Baltimore. \n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, I should take the left exit to get to Baltimore.\n</think>\n\n<answer>C\u00f3</answer>\n<explain>Chi\u1ebfc xe c\u1ea7n r\u1ebd tr\u00e1i v\u00e0o \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng d\u1eabn Baltimore theo ch\u1ec9 d\u1eabn tr\u00ean bi\u1ec3n b\u00e1o.
