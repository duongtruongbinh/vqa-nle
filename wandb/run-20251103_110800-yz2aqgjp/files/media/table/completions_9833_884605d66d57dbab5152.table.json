There are people on a beach with surfboards. Some are standing around under a tent, and others are carrying or adjusting their surfboards. The setting looks like a beach with buildings in the background. The presence of surfboards and people in swimwear suggests they're likely preparing for surfing. Surfing is a water sport, so the answer should be related to that. Let me confirm if there are any other sports evident here. No, the main focus is on the surfboards.

The image shows a group of people on a beach with some blue tents. There are surfboards on the sand, and people are standing around. Some are under the tents, others are walking or sitting. The question is asking what sport they are participating in. Well, the presence of surfboards is a strong clue. Surfing is a sport that requires a board and is typically done in the ocean. Since they're at a beach and there are surfboards lying on the sand, it's likely they are there for surfing. The people might be waiting for their turn, checking their boards, or maybe taking a break. The tents could be providing shade or serving as a resting area. No other sports equipment is visible here, like skateboards or tennis rackets.
