The question is asking if the plane in the image is a passenger plane. First, I need to check the details of the aircraft. The plane has the FedEx logo on it, which is a cargo carrier, not a typical passenger airline like Delta or American. The size of the plane also looks bigger, which is common for cargo planes used for transporting packages and mail. Passenger planes usually have a different design, maybe with windows and seats, but this one doesn't. Also, the livery is FedEx Express, which focuses on cargo. So, the answer should be no, it's not a passenger plane.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Kh\u00f4ng</answer>\n<explain>M\u00e1y bay n\u00e0y l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t m\u00e1y bay ch\u1edf h\u00e0ng FedEx, kh\u00f4ng ph\u1ea3i m\u00e1y bay ch\u1edf kh\u00e1ch.</explain>", 1.0, 1.0000001192092896, 0.5138409733772278, 0.5788707733154297, "<answer>kh\u00f4ng</answer><explain>tr\u00ean \u0111\u00f3 ghi fedex v\u00e0 fedex giao h\u00e0ng</explain>"]]}
