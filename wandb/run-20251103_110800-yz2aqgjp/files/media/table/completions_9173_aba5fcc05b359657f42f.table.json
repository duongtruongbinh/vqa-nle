The image shows a woman in the ocean, holding a surfboard. She's wearing a wetsuit. The question is asking what she's doing. So, she's probably surfing. But wait, she's standing in the water with the surfboard under her arm. Maybe she's just coming in after catching a wave, or preparing to go out. But the action she's captured here is holding the surfboard while walking in the water. So the answer should be that she's surfing or preparing to surf. The image also shows another person in the background, but the focus is on the woman. The answer needs to be in Vietnamese. The correct term for surfing in Vietnamese is \"l\u01b0\u1edbp s\u00f3ng\". So the answer is \"l\u01b0\u1edbp s\u00f3ng\" or \"chu\u1ea9n b\u1ecb l\u01b0\u1edbp s\u00f3ng\". But looking at the image, she's in the water with the board, so the action is l\u01b0\u1edbp s\u00f3ng.

The question is asking what the girl is doing in the image. The image shows a woman in the ocean with a surfboard under her arm. She's standing in the water, probably preparing to surf. There's another person in the background also with a surfboard. The waves are breaking around them. So, the main action here is that she's holding a surfboard and entering the water to surf. The key elements are the surfboard and the ocean environment. I need to make sure the answer is in Vietnamese and one word or short phrase. The answer should be something like \"ch\u00e0o s\u00f3ng\" which means surfing the waves. Let me confirm that \"ch\u00e0o s\u00f3ng\" is the correct term for the action of catching a wave on a surfboard. Yes, that's right.
