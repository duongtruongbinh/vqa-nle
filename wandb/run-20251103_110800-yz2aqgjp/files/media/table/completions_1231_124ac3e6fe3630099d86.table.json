The question is asking if the child in the image is preparing to snowboard. First, I need to look at the image carefully. There's a group of people around, some wearing helmets and snowboarding gear. The child in the center is sitting on the ground, and there's a snowboard next to them. But wait, the setting here looks more like a skate park or a paved area because there's asphalt and people are sitting on skateboards. The adult next to the child is bending over, maybe helping them. The child doesn't have a snowboard, but a regular one. The people around are dressed in sportswear, not typical winter clothing. The background is foggy, but it doesn't look like a snowy mountain. So, the child might be learning to skateboard, not snowboard. The question is about snowboarding, so the answer should be no. The child is likely getting ready for skateboarding instead.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Kh\u00f4ng</answer>\n<explain>Tr\u1ebb kh\u00f4ng ph\u1ea3i chu\u1ea9n b\u1ecb tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft, m\u00e0 c\u00f3 v\u1ebb \u0111ang chu\u1ea9n b\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec3 tr\u01b0\u1ee3t xe \u0111\u1ea1p ho\u1eb7c \u0111i d\u1ea1o tr\u00ean \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng.

The image shows a group of people on a road, some sitting on the ground and others standing. There's a child in the center, and the adults around him are dressed in winter sports gear. The setting looks like a mountainous area with fog or mist. \n\nThe main question is whether the child is preparing to ski. Wait, the image has people on snowboards and skis, not skis. So the child is on a snowboard. But the question says \"tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft\" which means skiing in Vietnamese. So the answer would be no because the child is on a snowboard, not a ski. But I need to check if the question is translated correctly. \"Tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft\" typically refers to skiing, but sometimes it's used more broadly. However, the equipment here is a snowboard, so the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Kh\u00f4ng</answer>\n<explain>Tr\u1ebb \u0111ang tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft, nh\u01b0ng \u0111\u00e2y l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ee9a tr\u1ebb nh\u1ecf h\u01a1n, kh\u00f4ng ph\u1ea3i ng\u01b0\u1eddi l\u1edbn, v\u00e0 em \u0111ang ng\u1ed3i tr\u00ean m\u1ed9t t\u1ea5m v\u00e1n tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft, kh\u00f4ng ph\u1ea3i c\u00e2y g\u1eady.
