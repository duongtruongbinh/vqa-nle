The question is asking if the baby is outside. Looking at the image, the baby is sitting with greenery in the background. The baby is wearing a diaper and holding a toothbrush. There's a pink blanket or cloth visible, which might be part of a stroller or outdoor seating. The baby's surroundings have green plants and leaves, which are outdoor elements. The baby doesn't have any visible indoor items like a blanket with patterns or indoor furniture. The lighting also seems natural, like daylight, which suggests it's outside.
