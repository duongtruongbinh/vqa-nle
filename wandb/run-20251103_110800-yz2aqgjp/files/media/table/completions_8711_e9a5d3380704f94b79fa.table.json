There's an elephant in a zoo or wildlife park. The question is asking if this animal has tusks. First, I need to remember the features of an elephant. Elephants do have tusks, which are those long white structures that extend from their mouths. In the image, the elephant's head is visible, and there do look like two protrusions on its face. These are the tusks. So the answer should be yes, it has tusks. But wait, sometimes people might confuse them with other features. But no, definitely the tusks.

The question is asking if the animal in the image has tusks. First, I need to identify what animal is in the picture. The image shows a large elephant walking on a dirt path. Elephants are known to have tusks, which are those long, white protrusions on their heads. But wait, there's also the possibility of a different species like a mammoth, but I don't think so here. Let me check the image again. The animal is definitely an elephant, which is a large, gray creature with a trunk and ears. The tusks are usually visible in male elephants. The image seems to show an adult elephant, so yes, it should have tusks.
