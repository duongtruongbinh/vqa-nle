The question is asking if the sky is clear. The image shows a blue sky with some clouds. So, I need to determine if \"tr\u1eddi c\u00f3 trong v\u1eaft\" means a clear sky. \n\nLooking at the image, the sky is mostly blue with scattered clouds. It's not completely cloudless, but the clouds are not covering the sky entirely. So, \"tr\u1eddi trong v\u1eaft\" would mean it's clear, but since there are clouds, maybe the answer is no. But sometimes people use \"tr\u1eddi trong v\u1eaft\" even with a few clouds, depending on context. However, the image has visible clouds, so the sky isn't completely clear.
