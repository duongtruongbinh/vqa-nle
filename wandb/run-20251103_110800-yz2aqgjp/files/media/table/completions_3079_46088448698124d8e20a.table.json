The user is asking if the laptop in the image is turned on. First, I need to look at the laptop's screen. The laptop is on the left side of the image. The screen shows a wallpaper with an animated character. If the laptop were off, the screen would be black or blank. Since there's a visible image on the screen, that means the laptop is powered on. Also, the keyboard is lit, which is another indication that it's on. The mouse connected to it might also be active, but even without that, the lit screen is enough.
