The image shows a person in a circus costume standing next to an elephant. The question is asking what kind of animals are depicted in the image. So, first, I need to identify the animals present.\n\nLooking at the image, there's clearly an elephant standing there. The elephant is wearing some sort of headpiece and leg bands, which is typical in circuses for performances. The person is likely a trainer or performer accompanying the elephant. The background is dark, focusing on the two main subjects. \n\nThe question is about the types of animals in the image. The only animal visible is the elephant. There are no other animals shown. The person is a human, but the question specifically asks about animals. So the answer should be the elephant. \n\nWait, maybe the person is a trainer, but the question is about the animals being depicted. So the answer is just the elephant. Let me double-check.
