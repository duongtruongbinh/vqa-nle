The image shows a person wearing a helmet and using ski poles while on a skateboard. Hmm, that seems a bit unusual. Normally, people use ski poles for skiing or maybe Nordic skiing. But he's on a skateboard instead of skis. Maybe it's a combination of skateboarding and skiing? I've heard of people using skateboards as a cross between a skateboard and skis. So he's probably practicing some kind of sport that involves a board like a skateboard but with poles. The term \"luy\u1ec7n t\u1eadp\" translates to practice or training. So the question is asking what sport he's training for. Given the equipment, it's likely a sport that combines elements of skateboarding and skiing, perhaps a new or emerging sport. I think the answer might be \"bobsleigh\" but wait, no. Bobsleigh is a team sport on a bobsleigh. Wait, maybe it's \"skateboard\" but with poles. Alternatively, maybe \"Nordic skiing\" but he's on a board. Oh, I remember there's a sport called \"skateboarding\" with poles used as handles. But the equipment looks more like Nordic skiing poles. Wait, the skateboard has wheels, but the poles are for balance. So maybe it's a training for a sport that involves a board similar to a skateboard but with poles. Alternatively, maybe it's a training for a specific activity, but the question asks for the sport. Maybe it's \"skateboarding\" but with poles. Wait, the answer might be \"skateboarding\" but the poles are for balance. Alternatively, the sport could be \"Nordic skiing\" but on a board. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the image shows a person on a skateboard with poles. That's not a standard sport. Wait, maybe it's a training for \"bobsleigh\" but no. Alternatively, maybe it's a training for a specific activity, but the question asks for the sport. Maybe the answer is \"skateboarding\" but that's not using poles. Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of skateboarding and something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a training for a sport like \"skateboarding\" with poles used as handles. Alternatively, maybe it's a training for a sport that involves using poles with a board, but I can't think of a standard sport that fits. Alternatively, maybe the sport is \"Nordic skiing\" but adapted to a board. But I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the answer is \"skateboarding\" but the poles are for balance. Alternatively, maybe the sport is \"bobsleigh\" but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a training for a sport called \"skateboarding\" but with poles. Alternatively, maybe it's a training for a sport that's a combination. Alternatively, maybe the sport is \"skiing\" but on a board. Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but based on the equipment, maybe the answer is \"skateboarding\" or \"Nordic skiing\" but I think the poles and the board might indicate a different sport.

The question is asking which sport the man in the image is practicing. The image shows a man wearing a yellow shirt and blue shorts, with a helmet and holding some kind of poles. He's on a path or road with a grassy area and trees around.\n\nHmm, the equipment he's holding looks like ski poles, and he's wearing skis instead of normal shoes. That makes me think he's doing cross-country skiing. The poles have handles, and cross-country skis are usually used for that sport. The helmet is also common safety gear for skiing, especially in cross-country to protect against falls or collisions.\n\nWait, but could it be something else? Maybe alpine skiing? But alpine skis are usually on a different setup and have bindings. The man's skis look like they're more suitable for cross-country, which is on snow, but maybe he's in a park with synthetic tracks. So the answer is probably cross-country skiing.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Cross-country skiing</answer>\n<explain>Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u00e0n \u00f4ng \u0111ang s\u1eed d\u1ee5ng \u0111\u1ed3 d\u00f9ng v\u00e0 d\u1ee5ng c\u1ee5 \u0111\u1eb7c tr\u01b0ng cho m\u00f4n th\u1ec3 thao n\u00e0y.</explain>", 1.0, 0.2617407441139221, 0.28486648201942444, 0.37538212537765503, "<answer>tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft</answer><explain>anh \u1ea5y mang v\u00e1n tr\u01b0\u1ee3t v\u00e0 gi\u00e0y tr\u01b0\u1ee3t tuy\u1ebft</explain>"], ["272", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Visual Question Answering system.
