The question is asking if the second cat is a reflection. In the image, there's a cat standing next to a mirror. The cat's reflection is visible in the mirror, so the one in front of the mirror is the actual cat, and the one in the mirror is the reflection. So the second cat, which is on the other side of the mirror, is just the real cat. The reflection is the mirrored image of the cat. So the answer should be no, the second cat isn't a reflection. Wait, but the reflection is part of the image, so the question might be a bit tricky. The cat in front of the mirror is real, and the reflection is the one in the mirror. So the second cat is the real one, and the reflection is the image of it. Therefore, the second cat is not a reflection; the reflection is the image.
