I remember that tennis courts are usually green or blue with white lines. The player is wearing a white shirt and dark pants, which is common for tennis attire. The other person in the background is also on the court, maybe a partner or another player. The setting is outdoors with trees and a fence, which is typical for tennis courts. The action of hitting a ball with a racket definitely points to tennis. There's no sign of other equipment like a basketball hoop or a soccer ball.
