The question is asking if the two zebras in the image are facing the same direction. I need to check their heads and the way they're oriented.\n\nLooking at the image, there are three zebras. The front two are clearly visible. The first zebra is facing left, with its head turned slightly to the side. The second zebra, which is behind the first, is also facing left but its head is more to the right, maybe because it's turned its head. Wait, but both of them are facing left. Even though their heads are turned a bit, their overall direction seems to be the same. The third zebra in the background is also facing left. So the answer should be yes, they are facing the same direction.\n</think>\n\n<answer>C\u00f3</answer>,  \n<explain>C\u1ea3 hai con ng\u1ef1a v\u1eb1n trong h\u00ecnh \u0111\u1ec1u quay v\u1ec1 ph\u00eda b\u00ean tr\u00e1i, d\u00f9 \u0111\u1ea7u c\u1ee7a ch\u00fang quay m\u1ed9t g\u00f3c kh\u00e1c nhau.
