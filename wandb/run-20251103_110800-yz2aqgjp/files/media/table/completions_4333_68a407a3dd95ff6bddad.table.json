The question is asking what the building in the image is made of. The image shows a giraffe standing in front of a structure. The building has a brick exterior, so the main material is probably brick. But I should check if there are other materials too. The roof looks like it's made of metal, maybe a corrugated metal sheet. The structure has a door, and the wall has a mix of brick and maybe some metal panels. So the primary material is brick, and the roof is metal. The answer should mention both, but the question might be asking for the main material. Let me confirm by looking at the image again. Yes, the walls are clearly brick, and the roof is metal. So the answer should state that the building is made of brick with a metal roof.\n</think>\n\n<answer>b\u00ea t\u00f4ng v\u00e0 kim lo\u1ea1i</answer>\n<explain>T\u00f2a nh\u00e0 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c x\u00e2y d\u1ef1ng ch\u1ee7 y\u1ebfu b\u1eb1ng b\u00ea t\u00f4ng v\u1edbi l\u1edbp s\u01a1n ho\u1eb7c \u1ed1p g\u1ea1ch, v\u00e0 m\u00e1i nh\u00e0 \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c l\u00e0m t\u1eeb kim lo\u1ea1i, c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 l\u00e0 t\u00f4n ho\u1eb7c t\u1ea5m kim lo\u1ea1i nh\u1eb9.
