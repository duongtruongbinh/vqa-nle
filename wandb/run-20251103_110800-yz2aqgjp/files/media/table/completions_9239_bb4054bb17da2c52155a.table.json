The question is asking if the man in the image has gray hair. I need to check the image for that detail.\n\nLooking at the man, he has white hair. Wait, the question specifies \"gr\u7070\" which might be a typo. The original question in Vietnamese says \"Anh \u1ea5y c\u00f3 t\u00f3c b\u1ea1c kh\u00f4ng?\" which translates to \"Does he have gray hair?\" So, the user is asking if the man has gray hair.\n\nIn the image, the man has white hair. White hair can be considered as gray in some contexts, but sometimes people distinguish between white and gray hair. However, in common terms, white hair is often referred to as gray hair.
