The question is asking what they are drinking. I need to look at the image to find clues about the drinks.\n\nFirst, I notice there are glasses on the table.

The question is \"H\u1ecd \u0111ang u\u1ed1ng g\u00ec?\" which means \"What are they drinking?\" in Vietnamese. I need to look at the image and figure out what's being consumed by the people in the picture.\n\nLooking at the image, there are three men sitting at a table. In front of them are glasses on the table. The first man on the left is holding a glass, and there's another glass on the table. The second man in the middle is looking down, maybe at a phone, and there's a glass in front of him too. The third man on the right is also looking at something, possibly a phone, and has a glass in front of him as well.\n\nSo, all three men have glasses in front of them. The contents of the glasses aren't clearly visible, but since they're sitting in a social setting, it's common for people to drink beverages like beer, wine, or maybe cocktails. The presence of a watch on one person's wrist might suggest they're keeping track of time, perhaps waiting for others to join or have been there for a while. The atmosphere looks like a casual social gathering, maybe a bar or a restaurant.\n\nBut the key detail here is the glasses. If I can't see the exact drink, I have to make an educated guess. In many social settings, especially with friends, beer is a common drink. However, there's also the possibility of wine or other alcoholic beverages. Since the image is a bit dark, maybe the glasses are filled with beer. But without seeing the color or clarity, it's hard to be certain. However, the most likely answer here, given typical scenarios, would be that they are drinking beer or wine.\n\nWait, but the image might have a shot glass or a glass that's more typical for beer. The person on the left has a watch on his wrist, which is common for people who might be more detail-oriented, but not necessarily indicative of the drink. The middle person is looking at a phone, so maybe he's not paying attention to the drink. The third person is looking at something else. So the main point is the glasses in front of them.\n\nSince all three have glasses, and assuming they are alcoholic beverages, the answer would be beer. But maybe it's something else. However, in the context of the image, with the people looking relaxed and having drinks, beer is a common assumption. So the answer would be that they are drinking beer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Beer</answer>\n<explain>They are sitting in a social setting with glasses in front of them, which typically suggest drinking beer or wine.
