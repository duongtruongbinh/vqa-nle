Let me look at the image again. There's a car parked on the right side, and next to it on the grass, there's a bird with a prominent blue and green plumage. The bird has a long neck and looks a bit like a peacock. I remember that peacocks have those bright blue and green feathers, especially males. They also have a crested head and a long tail, but in this case, the bird's tail isn't visible here. The bird's neck is extended, which is typical for peacocks when they're displaying. The feathers on its neck and chest look iridescent, which is a characteristic of peacocks. So, putting this together, the bird is most likely a peacock.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Peacock</answer>\n<explain>Because the bird has a bright blue and green plumage, a long neck, and is standing on grass next to a car, resembling the appearance of a peacock.</explain>", 1.0, 0.2855866253376007, 0.5864694118499756, 1.1201741695404053, "<answer>con c\u00f4ng</answer><explain>n\u00f3 c\u00f3 m\u1ed9t c\u00e1i c\u1ed5 d\u00e0i m\u00e0u xanh v\u00e0 l\u00f4ng \u0111\u1ea7y m\u00e0u s\u1eafc</explain>"], ["489", "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a Visual Question Answering system.
