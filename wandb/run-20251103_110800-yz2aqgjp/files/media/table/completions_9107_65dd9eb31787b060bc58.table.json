Wait, he's wearing a cap, not a hat. The other man next to him is wearing a blue shirt with a number 10 and a baseball cap. But the question is about the man on the right. He has a checkered scarf on his head, like a beanie. So the answer should be a cap. The other options might be hats or something else, but the man is wearing a cap. Let me double-check. The person on the far right has a cap, yes. The scarf is around his head, but the cap is the main thing.
