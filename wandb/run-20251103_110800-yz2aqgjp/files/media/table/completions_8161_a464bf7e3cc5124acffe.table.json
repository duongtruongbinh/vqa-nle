The stripes are vertical on their legs and horizontal on their bodies. These are all characteristics of zebras. They live in grasslands, often seen in groups. The image shows three zebras standing together, which is common for them.

The question is asking \"\u0110\u00e2y l\u00e0 con v\u1eadt g\u00ec?\" which means \"What kind of animal is this?\" in Vietnamese. Looking at the image, there are three zebras standing on a dirt ground with some grass in the background. They have the distinctive black and white stripes, which are characteristic of zebras. I need to make sure I'm not confusing them with other animals like wildebeests or giraffes. The stripes and their posture suggest they're definitely zebras.
