There's a man standing on snow, wearing a black jacket and ski gear. The question is asking if he has a shadow. To figure this out, I need to check if his figure is cast on the snow.\n\nIn the image, the man's shadow is visible on the snow to his right. The shadow is darker and follows the outline of his body. The direction of the shadow suggests the light source is coming from the left, which makes sense for outdoor lighting, especially in snowy conditions where the sun might be low. The presence of the shadow confirms that he's being lit by a light source, likely the sun, which is typical for snowy landscapes. There are no other people or objects obstructing the shadow, so it's clear. Therefore, the answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\n<answer>C\u00f3</answer>\n<explain>Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u00e0n \u00f4ng c\u00f3 b\u00f3ng tr\u00ean m\u1eb7t tuy\u1ebft do \u00e1nh s\u00e1ng t\u1eeb ph\u00eda b\u00ean tr\u00e1i chi\u1ebfu xu\u1ed1ng.</explain>", 1.0, 0.0, 0.3465768098831177, -1.1268147230148315, "<answer>\u0111\u00fang</answer><explain>\u0111\u01b0\u1eddng vi\u1ec1n c\u1ee7a n\u00f3 tr\u00ean tuy\u1ebft m\u00e0u x\u00e1m.</explain>"]]}
