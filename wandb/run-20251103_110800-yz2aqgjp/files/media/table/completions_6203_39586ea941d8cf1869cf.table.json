The question is asking if the computer in the image is on. First, I need to look at the computer monitor. If the screen is displaying something, then it's on. If it's black, maybe it's turned off. In the image, the monitor shows a desktop with some icons and a taskbar visible. That usually means the computer is turned on. Also, the keyboard and mouse are placed in front of the monitor, which might indicate that it's ready for use. There's also a headset on the desk, which people often leave on when they're using the computer.
