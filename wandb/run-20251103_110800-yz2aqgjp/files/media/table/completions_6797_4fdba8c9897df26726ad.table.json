The question is asking if the grass needs to be cut. The image shows a man standing in a grassy area with some trees in the background. The grass looks pretty green and well-maintained.

But if the grass is too long, it might look unkempt. The man is dressed casually, wearing shorts, which suggests that the weather is warm, so the grass might grow quickly in that case. However, the image doesn't show any tools or signs of maintenance work. The grass appears healthy, so maybe it doesn't need cutting right now. But without seeing the actual length of the grass, it's hard to tell. Maybe the answer is no, but I'm not entirely sure. The key point is that the grass looks well-kept, so cutting might not be necessary.\n</think>\n\n<answer>C\u00f3</answer>\n<explain>C\u00f3 v\u1ebb c\u1ea7n c\u1eaft c\u1ecf v\u00ec th\u1ea3m c\u1ecf trong h\u00ecnh c\u00f3 m\u00e0u xanh r\u1ef1c r\u1ee1, c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 c\u1ea7n \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c duy tr\u00ec \u0111\u1ec3 tr\u00e1nh l\u00e1 c\u1ecf b\u1ecbte ho\u1eb7c c\u1ecf kh\u00f4.

There's a person standing on a grassy field with some trees in the background. The grass looks pretty even and not overgrown. There's a frisbee on the ground, but it doesn't seem like the grass is too long or uneven, which might indicate that it's maintained regularly. Since the grass isn't patchy or uneven, it's likely that someone would need to mow it to keep it that way. But the image doesn't show any mowing equipment or someone mowing, so maybe the grass is naturally short. However, without seeing the entire area or knowing if it's part of a maintained lawn, it's hard to be certain.
