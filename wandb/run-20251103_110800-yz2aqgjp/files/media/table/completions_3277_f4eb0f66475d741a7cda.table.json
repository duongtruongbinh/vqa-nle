No, the person is using skis, so it's definitely skiing. They're descending the slope, which is typical for skiing. The equipment and the setting all point to skiing.

Let me check the details. The person is wearing a helmet, goggles, and has ski poles in hand. They're dressed in winter gear, including a jacket and pants. The surroundings are covered in snow, with trees on both sides. They're moving down a snowy slope. The skis are clearly visible, and the person's posture suggests they're actively skiing downhill. The question is asking what sport they're playing. The answer should be skiing. But wait, let me make sure. Could it be snowboarding? No, because there's no board visible; it's definitely skis. Also, the way they're holding the poles and the skis are attached to their feet. So yes, skiing is the correct answer.
