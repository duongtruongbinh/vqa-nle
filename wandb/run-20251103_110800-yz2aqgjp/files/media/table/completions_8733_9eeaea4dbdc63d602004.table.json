The question is asking about a white car and an SUV. In the image, there's a white car on the road next to the cyclist. It looks like a sedan or a small SUV. The other vehicles are the buses and the trolley. The SUV isn't immediately obvious, but maybe the car in question is considered an SUV. The answer should be \"C\u00f4\" for the white car and \"xe SUV\" for the SUV. Wait, but in the image, there's no clear SUV. Maybe the white car is the one. Let me check again. The white car is on the road, and the SUV might be another one further back, but it's not clear.
