Let me look at the image again. The man is outdoors, surrounded by trees. He's reaching out towards a frisbee in the air. His hat is a pink color. Now, the question is about the type of hat he's wearing. \n\nFirst, I should identify the shape and style of the hat. The man is wearing a hat that looks like a cowboy hat. They have a wide brim, a rounded crown, and the material seems to be leather. The pink color is unusual for a traditional cowboy hat, which are often more brown or black. But the style is still similar to a cowboy hat. \n\nWait, could it be something else? Maybe a sombrero? No, a sombrero is usually part of Mexican culture, more rectangular and flat. Or maybe a boater hat? No, those are more square. The key features here are the wide brim and the crown shape. Yeah, that's a cowboy hat. \n\nSo the answer should be cowboy hat. Let me confirm. The man's hat has a brim and a crown that's typical of a cowboy hat. Yep, that's right.\n</think>\n\n<answer>cowboy hat</answer>\n<explain>Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u00e0n \u00f4ng \u0111ang \u0111\u1ed9i m\u1ed9t chi\u1ebfc m\u0169 c\u00f3 brim r\u1ed9ng v\u00e0 ki\u1ec3u d\u00e1ng \u0111\u1eb7c tr\u01b0ng c\u1ee7a cowboy hat, v\u1edbi th\u00e2n m\u0169 n\u00f3n v\u00e0 ph\u1ea7n n\u00f3n l\u1edbn.
