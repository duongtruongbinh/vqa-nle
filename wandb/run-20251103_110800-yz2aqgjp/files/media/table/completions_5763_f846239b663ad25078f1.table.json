The person is standing on a snowy mountain with a clear blue sky in the background.\n\nWait, the question is about whether he has a snowboard. But the person is wearing skis, not a snowboard. Snowboards are flat, and you ride on them with a single boot, while skis have two skis. In the image, he's clearly skiing, not snowboarding. So the answer should be no. Let me double-check. The person's feet are on skis, not a snowboard. There's no visible snowboard attached to him.
