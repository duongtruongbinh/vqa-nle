Let me look at the picture again. There are tall animals with long necks and spotted patterns. They're behind a fence, probably in a zoo or sanctuary.\n\nHmm, the spots are quite distinctive. The main features I see are the long necks, legs, and the pattern. I remember that giraffes have those brown and white patches. Also, they're standing in an enclosure with trees in the background. Maybe it's a giraffe family? One adult and a younger one. Yeah, that makes sense. The spots and the size suggest they're giraffes. I don't think they're other animals like llamas or zebras because those have different patterns.
