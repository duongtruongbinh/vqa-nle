The question is asking what the building is made of. The image shows a two-story house. From what I can see, the exterior is light-colored with siding. The front door is on the ground floor, and there are two motorcycles parked in front. There are also some signs, one of which says \"Bank & Credit Union\" and another mentions a business with \"3000\" visible. The structure has a shingled roof. \n\nLooking at the materials, the siding appears to be vinyl or maybe wood, which is common for houses. The roof has shingles, which are typical for residential buildings. There's a wooden staircase leading up to the door. So putting that together, the building is likely made of wood, with siding (possibly vinyl or wood siding) and a shingled roof. I don't see any obvious signs of brick or concrete, so the primary material would be wood. The answer should mention wood as the main material, possibly specifying the siding and roof materials.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Kim lo\u1ea1i</answer>\n<explain>Kh\u00f4ng, t\u00f2a nh\u00e0 kh\u00f4ng \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c l\u00e0m b\u1eb1ng kim lo\u1ea1i.
