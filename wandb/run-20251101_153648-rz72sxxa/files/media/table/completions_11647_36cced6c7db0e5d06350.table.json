I should check if there are any other possibilities, but given the physical characteristics, it's safe to say this is a giraffe.

The background is some greenery, suggesting it might be in a natural habitat or a zoo. The combination of the long neck, spotted coat, and ossicones makes me think this is a giraffe.
