The question is asking if the woman in the image has black hair. First, I need to look at the woman in the picture. She's wearing a grey hoodie and a brown beanie. Now, the beanie covers part of her hair, but I can see some hair strands around the beanie. The color of her hair looks dark, but I need to be sure. Sometimes hair color can be tricky, especially if it's covered by hats or coats. Let me check again. The woman's hair visible in the image appears to be dark, possibly black or very dark brown. The beanie is light brown, so it doesn't affect the hair color much. The child next to her is wearing a black helmet, but that's not relevant here. So, based on what I can see, the woman's hair is dark, so the answer would be yes.\n</think>\n\n<answer>C\u00f3</answer>\n<explain>Ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef trong h\u00ecnh c\u00f3 t\u00f3c \u0111en, th\u1ec3 hi\u1ec7n qua m\u00e0u t\u00f3c xanh \u0111\u1eadm v\u00e0 c\u00e1c s\u1ee3i t\u00f3c c\u00f3 th\u1ec3 th\u1ea5y r\u00f5 ngo\u00e0i m\u0169 len.
